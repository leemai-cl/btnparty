# Button Party



This portfolio project is part of the Code Louisville track completion requirements.

There are CSS and Javascript elements described below:

1. A CSS animation that runs on loading the page, spinning the title
2. A navigation menu that expands and collapses at desktop and mobile sizes
3. Hide/show content on the page (jQuery)
4. Javascript for loop and form validation to create any number of useless buttons

Media queries were used to shift content into columns and for the navigation menu.
There are also a few javascript click functions as filler.

Thank you for the opportunity to dive into this project!
